## Tuts+ Course: Build an Email Application With Ruby
### Instructor: Jos√© Mota

Ruby is much more than web development. In fact, it can do really great things
in your own system. If you'd like to find out more, jump into the course to learn about how to interact with email servers, with a focus on good software development practices and craftmanship. We'll create our very own email application with Ruby and publish it to a private gem repository.
